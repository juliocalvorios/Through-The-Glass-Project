## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** - Data fetching & caching
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env.local` with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Get a free API key at: https://openweathermap.org/api

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Demo Mode

Without an API key, the app runs in demo mode with mock weather data. Use the weather selector (bottom left) to test different conditions.

## Roadmap

- **v2**: Aurora borealis, fog effect, smooth transitions, ambient sounds
- **v3**: Decorative elements, easter eggs, forecast view
- **v4**: Seasonal decorations, time travel calendar
